        <div class="item">This is where InkForge differs from it's competition, we have no servers to run an ai nor store user data on. Due to advancments in technology particularly in the AI field in the early 20s we have a model that is able to be run entirely within your web browser.</div>
        <div class="item">The use of this model means that your stories are entirely yours with no limitations. You can also be sure that your data is secure as the only server involved in the process is the server hosting the website itself.</div>
        <div class="item">FOSS (Free Open Source Software) is an important philosophy and ensures that the inner workings of software is freely known as well as ensuring equal access to everywhere with an internet connection.</div>
        <div class="item">We have followed FOSS principles by making our code available on github in a public repository and the AI model we use is available on hugging face. AIDungeon and Character.ai are both closed source however.</div>
        <div class="item">Make sure to check out our github either by clicking my name at the top of the site of clicking the link in the footer üòÅ</div>
